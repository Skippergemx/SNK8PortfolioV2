# SNK8 Art Showcase Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the evolution of the `snk8-portfolio` from a static landing page to a world-class digital art showcase.

## Phase 1: Architectural Foundation (Modularization)
- [x] **Data Extraction**: Move `WORKS` and `JOURNALS` to `src/data/content.js`.
- [x] **Component Extraction**: Create `src/components/` and isolate.
- [x] **State Management**: Refine theme and tab state handling.

## Phase 2: Immersive Art Interaction
- [x] **Liquid Lightbox**: Full-screen high-res modal with spring animations.
- [x] **Carousel 2.0**: Scroll-linked rotation and auto-spin combination.

## Phase 3: Kinetic Polish & Aesthetic Depth
- [x] **Visual FX**: Hover states with blur and overlay.
- [x] **Custom Interaction**: Glowing, context-aware cursor.

## Phase 4: Final Polish & Launch Prep
- [x] **Performance**: Implemented lazy loading and optimized image rendering.
- [x] **Responsive Audit**: Flawless 3D carousel and lightbox scaling across devices.
- [x] **Narrative Pass**: Refined micro-copy and typography scales for premium feel.
